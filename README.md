# Arabic NLP
 # Arabic NLP  This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on Arabic text processing. The project leverages **Qalsadi** for lemmatization and tokenization, and **NLTK** for stemming and additional text processing utilities. The goal is to provide a robust pipeline for preprocessing Arabic text, which can be used for downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.  ## Features  - **Tokenization**: Splitting Arabic text into words or subwords using Qalsadi. - **Lemmatization**: Converting Arabic words to their base or dictionary forms using Qalsadi. - **Stemming**: Reducing Arabic words to their root forms using NLTK's ISRI Stemmer. - **Text Normalization**: Removing diacritics (Tashkeel) and unifying Arabic characters.  ## Libraries Used  - **[Qalsadi](https://github.com/linuxscout/qalsadi)**: For Arabic lemmatization and tokenization. - **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)**: For stemming and additional text processing utilities.  ## Usage  1. Clone the repository:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Arabic-NLP.git    cd Arabic-NLP
